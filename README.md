# Palindrome

This Python program checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome. If not, it generates a new palindrome by appending the reverse of the cleaned input.

## 💡 What It Does

- Takes a word or phrase input from the user.
- Converts it to lowercase and removes all spaces for accurate palindrome checking.
- Checks if the cleaned string is a palindrome.
- If it is a palindrome, it confirms it.
- If not, it creates and displays a new palindrome by appending the reverse of the cleaned string.

## 📁 File

- `palindrome.py`: Contains the program code.
